/**
 * Loaded with `--import` before any test module: `node --test` passes it to every test file's process. A shell inside
 * Pi sets `PI_*` variables that point pi-warden at the developer's trace directory, database, index, and agent
 * directory, and turn consent or a mode on; a test run must neither read nor write them. Every `PI_*` variable and every
 * judge key is cleared, so no test can reach a real judge, and each process gets its own empty agent directory, removed
 * when it exits. A test that needs a variable sets it itself.
